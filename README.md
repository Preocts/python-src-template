This is a template example of how I structure an initial python project.

# Module Name

Module Description

### Requirements
- Python 3.8

## Local developer installation

It is **highly** recommended to use a `venv` for installation. Leveraging a `venv` will ensure the installed dependency files will not impact other python projects.

The instruction below make use of a bash shell and a Makefile.  All commands should be able to be run individually of your shell does not support `make`

Clone this repo and enter root directory of repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Preocts/[MODULE_NAME]
$ cd [MODULE_NAME]
```

Create and activate `venv`:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Your command prompt should now have a `(venv)` prefix on it.

Install editable library and development requirements:
```bash
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
(venv) $ pip install --editable .
```

Run tests
```bash
(venv) $ tox
```

To exit the `venv`:
```bash
(venv) $ deactivate
```

### Makefile

This repo has a Makefile with some quality of life scripts if your system supports `make`.

- `update` : Clean all artifacts, update pip, update requirements, install everything
- `clean-pyc` : Deletes python/mypy artifacts
- `clean-tests` : Deletes tox, coverage, and pytest artifacts
