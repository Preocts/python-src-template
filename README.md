A template I use for most projects.

This is not the one-shot solution to project structure or packaging. This is
just what works well for one egg on the Internet. Feel free to use it as you see
fit.

## FAQ

- **Q:** Should I follow everything to the absolute letter in this template?
  - **A:** Heck no, I don't even do that! This is just the closest
    one-size-fits-most template I've put together. Use what you want how you
    want.

- **Q:** Why does this template change so often?
  - **A:** I'm constantly finding new tweaks that make the template fit just a
    little better. I'm also open to ideas and suggestions so please drop an
    issue if you have one.

- **Q:** Why nox?
  - **A:** Duplicatable workflows that are platform agnostic. Whether locally,
    in a container, in a github action, or on your machine; there is one
    official way workflows are run.
