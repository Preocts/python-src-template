## TODO

- Auto detect use of `requirements.txt` and insert into `setup.cfg`
- Publish write-up on the /src layout
- CLI tool for starting new project without cloning/using template
- Version bump shell script

This is a template example of how I structure an initial python project.

## What's included in (how to use) this template

## `./src` Layout

This template uses a package layout that forces the developer to have the
package installed locally for testing. This is done by nesting the package
modules within the `src` directory. The `src` directory is not, itself, a module
and should not be referenced from imports. The benefit of this layout is that
all tests are run against **installed** code which is closer to an actual
deployment. Additionally, the developer will have the confidence that the
`setup.cfg` is correctly including the desired modules as the tests will fail if
they do not install correctly.

## `setup.cfg`

The configuration settings of `setup.py` have been moved into `setup.cfg`. In
addition, `setup.cfg` contains the settings for these additional items:

- mypy
- coverage
- flake8

When using this template, be sure the `setup.py` is edited to reflect the
desired `[metadata]` values and supported python versions.

Add as needed for third party library requirements:

```cfg
[options]
install_requires =
    library_name
    other_library_name==2.3
```

## pytest

pytest is used to run tests for this template. It supports the unittest
framework as well. The only requirement is that all test files be located in the
`./tests` directory.

## Coverage

Coverage is used to run pytest, measuring code coverage and exporting two
reports on a successful run. `coverage.xml` and an html version located in
`coverage_html_report`. `.xml` is for CodeCov and the html goes to a local tool
for review. Strip out what you don't need/want.

**Note:** As you add modules to the library you will need to edit the
`setup.cfg` and add the module names (directory name) to the `[coverage:run]`
list of `source_pkgs`.

```cfg
[coverage:run]
source_pkgs =
    module_name
```

## `tox.ini`

tox is the method of choice for running unit tests. The program simplifies the
task of running tests against multiple versions of python. Running all tests
should be as simple as running `tox` at the command line. Missing interpreter
versions will be skipped without error. Be sure to install testing specific
libraries in the default command list if you add any. `coverage` and `pytest`
are installed by default of the template.

**Note:** By default a coverage percentage of **90**% is required to pass. This
can be adjusted as desired in the `tox.ini`.

## `requirements-dev.txt`

The requirements-dev.in (and *.txt) includes the following for a dev
environment:

- `pre-commit`: Linting, formatting, and error checks on local commit
- `black`: Formatter of choice, installed to allow editor to run on save
- `mypy`: Type checking and linting of code in editor
- `flake8`: Linting of code in PEP8 standard in editor
- `pytest`: Testing framework of choice
- `coverage`: Identify weak points of testing
- `tox`: Run tests in isolated environments mirroring clean installs

## pre-commit - [https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/)

Installed with dev requirements, pre-commit will run a series of checks against
any file being committed to the local repo by `git`.  See
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` for a list of checks used.

**Note:** `pre-commit install` will need to be run the first time the local repo
is initialized.

## .github actions

**`python-tests.yml`**: This registers a GitHub action that runs tests via tox
on any pull request against `main` and any push to `main`. The tests are run on
the lastest version of the following OS images:

- MacOS
- Windows
- Ubuntu

Versions, OS choices, and when to run the tests can be easily changed in this
yml file.

**Additionally** CodeCov is included in the workflow here. This final step can
be removed as desired.
