cd [REPO NAME]
```

### [Install nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html)

It is recommended to use a tool such as `pipx` or `uvx` to install nox. nox is
needed to run the provided sessions for developer setup, linting, tests, and
dependency management. It is optional, but these instructions will not cover
manually steps outside of nox.


## Nox Sessions

### Developer Install

This builds the `/.venv`, installs the editable
package, and installs all dependency files.

```bash
nox -s dev
```

### Run tests with coverage

```bash
nox -s test
```

### Run formatters and linters

```bash
nox -s lint
```

### Build dist

```bash
nox -s build
```

## Updating dependencies

New dependencys can be added to the `requirements-*.txt` file. It is recommended
to only use pins when specific versions or upgrades beyond a certain version are
to be avoided. Otherwise, allow `pip-compile` to manage the pins in the
generated `constraints.txt` file.

Once updated following the steps below, the package can be installed if needed.

### Update the generated files with changes

```bash
nox -s update-deps
```

### Upgrade all generated dependencies

```bash
nox -s upgrade-deps
```
