- ### Do

  - snake_case modules, variables, methods, and functions
  - PascalCase classes
  - Type-hint function/method signatures
  - Use verbs for getters/setters (`get_`, `fetch_`, `pull_`, `save_`, `put_`)
  - Use singular form for objects
  - Use plural form for lists/sequences

- ### Do Not

  - Fight `black` formatting

- ### Comments

  - Keep comments short and to the point
  - Let code explain "what" and comments explain "why"
  - All modules, functions, class, and methods must have a doc-string
  - Doc-strings are optional in tests when the test name explains "what"

- ### Tests

  - Smaller tests are easier to work with
  - Mock at a minimum
  - No test should be dependent on another
  - No test should be dependent on secrets/tokens
